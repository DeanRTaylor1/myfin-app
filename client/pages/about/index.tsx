              </h1>
              <p className='w-full text-left'>

                backgrounds, our primary objective is to offer a simple way for
                you to manage your finances. Financial literacy is not something
                that is taught in schools and as you we move through the modern
                world, there are more and more pressures to spend money.
                Holidays, tech, gifts, restaurants... MyFin offers a way for you
                to log and track your finances.

              <p className='w-full text-left '>
                We believe in keeping things simple by setting small daily
                spending targets, whilst being able to track spending over
                multiple weeks or months. Check summaries of what you&apos;re
                spending your money on and decide where could cut costs. The
                methods applied by MyFin have been used by our team to manage
                our personal finances to great success. Meet your savings
                targets this year!
